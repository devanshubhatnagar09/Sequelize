# Sequelize Table Creation and Data Insertion App

This is a simple web application built using Express.js and Sequelize, allowing users to create a table and add data to it dynamically.

## Features

- **Table Creation**: Users can create a table by specifying its name and column definitions.
- **Data Insertion**: Once a table is created, users can add data to it by providing values for each column.
- **Express.js**: Utilize Express.js for server-side routing and logic.
- **Sequelize**: Integrate Sequelize ORM for handling database operations and model definitions.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the database connection:

   - Open `config/config.json` and update the database configuration according to your database setup (e.g., host, username, password, database name).

4. Run the migrations to create database tables:

   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

5. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.

## Usage

- Navigate to the application home page.
- Use the provided form to create a table by specifying its name and column definitions.
- After creating the table, navigate to the table's page.
- Use the provided form to insert data into the table by providing values for each column.
- Submit the form to insert the data into the database.

## Dependencies

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/): Promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and Microsoft SQL Server.

## File Structure

- `app.js`: Main application file containing server setup and route definitions.
- `config/`: Directory for storing database configuration files.
- `models/`: Directory for storing Sequelize model definitions.
- `migrations/`: Directory for storing Sequelize migration files.
- `views/`: Directory for storing view templates (e.g., HTML, EJS).

## Configuration

- `config/config.json`: Sequelize configuration file specifying database connection settings.
- `.env`: Environment configuration file (not included in this sample).
